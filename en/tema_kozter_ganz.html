          <td colspan="3" class="normal"><p> <strong>GANZ Pipes or thoughts about the connection between contemporary public-place plastic art and architecture </strong> </p>
            <p>Is there any receptivity of public-place sculpture acting by the simplicity of pure form? </p>
            <p>May we part from the evidence, the primary message of bronze moustaches and figures frozen into stone? </p>
            <p>What kind of sculptural performance means a more consequent, organic connection between today's architecture, landscape architecture and public-place sculpture? </p>
            <p>May we set up sculptures, buildings, parks for ourselves or all participants should take part in the composition as adhering parts of a great whole, as elements of an urbane land-art subordinated to the final harmony? </p>
            <p>May we allow that public place be the field of uncontrolled and pushing self-assertion, that of formalistic gag falls, lacking every submission? </p>
            <p>May the striving for durability, also in mentality and form of appearance, be mistaken for the dumping of up-to-date, fast consumable but the next day indigestible supply of industrial-fair ideas lacking mental basis? </p>
            <p>May a rusty steel surface, declared unpresentable, and at the same time stupidly considered as a symbol of pass only, have a rank, as an unbelievably lively surface of colour richness surpassing even the finest painters' trouvailles from warmest black through soft claret up to vivid orange red? </p>
            <p>May the stock of plastic art's tools be limited by anything? </p>
            <p>Does the architect or landscape architect act well, if he/she designs the smaller, subordinated but very important parts of a large "three-dimensional piece of art" (house, park, etc.) on his/her own, or if he/she admits that these scale and space relations may perhaps have a fresher result by the involvement of a sculptor, adding value to the building finally? </p>
            <p>They establish together an art team, and a common piece of art. </p>
            <p>The often arising space elements of subordinated functions, such as air-conditioning equipment, ventilation windows of underground garages and the like may be interesting challenges for expert creators of functional three-dimensional pieces of art, i.e. sculptors. It would be worth perhaps introducing the attendant artists in order not to make more ships' horns welded from pipe slices, and glass pyramids with metal frame. </p>
            <p>In the framework of designing Millenary Park I myself was charged with the designing of monumental glass sculptures built on the creation of a sort of film-like series of virtual sights by the viewers with the simplicity of minimal art (CORTEN steel and plate-glass). </p>
            <p>Because of more important points of view than the appearance of contemporary fine art, and as a consequence of the decision of some forces these plans could not be realised. There is still no place today in the world of formalistic one-point gags for durable works bearing long-term values. </p>
            <p>Reverting however to our original subject I felt the establishment of the harmony of a park and a group of buildings jeopardised when I heard of the ideas arisen in connection with the ventilation windows of the underground garage. Thus on the encouragement of the architect, Mr. László Benczúr I designed a perhaps properly large-scale and large-size 3D work of art, a tilted glass parallelogram. These 4 pieces of 1.5 m diameter and 10 m long openings of concrete would have been united by this work of art, and be connected to the park and the built environment by its special refraction and reflections of light. (I met a much smaller and by metal structures dissected variation of that some months later during my visit in Berlin, Potsdamer Platz, built in a very exciting architectural and landscape architectural environment /Sony Centrum, Renso Piano/ where I have not found the dividing line between the mentality and realisation of architectural and landscape architectural work.) </p>
            <p>After the above idea had also failed (for petty considerations), I proposed the establishment of a human-scale plastic work of art, not dominating but still prevailing the environment. </p>
            <p>In its method of form treatment it reminds mainly of the organic connections between the leaves and the stems of a plant. At the same time the abruptly abandoned industrial shaping, the frozen state of metal procession may perhaps refer in its meaning to the industrial past "made vanish", also feeling the characteristic rhythm of the group of plastic works of art. The size of the single elements of the sculpture varies between 3 and 4 meters which provides a special, fine rhythm, similarly as the figures of a group of people relate to one-another. The method of steel treatment lacks every artificial, flirtingly aesthetic airs. It applies the unsophisticated values of industrial aesthetics, making use of the fallibility displaying a result reminding of a graphic line made by the stop of a worker's hand. </p>
            <p>The splits made on the superficies of the cylinder do not want to violate the symmetrical body of revolution but being subordinated to it to be blended into it, and get torn from it organically. 
            The piece of cylinder superficies split along the askew line gets beautifully open owing to the tension inherent in the material since the process of rolling, and leaves the mother body. Having been freed in this way this surface begins a fine dance in a medium-strong wind. </p>
            <p>The vertical superficies split reminds mostly of the sensitive gesture of a weapon's sight, the split material remained leans over to the gap on the opposite side. The other vertical split becomes a plastic, tension creating element also by leaving the original manufactured state. I was interested in the cleanness and the sculptural excitement of these means when I designed a "ventilation window of underground garage". </p>
            <p>I planned to place hidden reflectors to the internal edges of the corroded steel tubes which could project through the splits a strange, geometric light-shadow graphic on the light-coloured surface of the place as a kind of screen. I showed this graphic with the help of a model experiment. The effect did not failed, it was rejected. This is really missing from the evening sight today. The steel sculpture standing on its own shadow-graphic may be an independent sight element of the park. </p>
            <p>The chosen material (CORTEN-steel) is used in international fine arts long ago. Only the upper layer of a few microns becomes corroded. The corrosion process provides a steadily changing, lively view. As a functional sculpture, it had to meet also technical requirements. In an excellent co-operation with the static and mechanical engineers we made a water channel system hidden in the sculpture. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately the sculpture has since been surrounded by further gag boxes and so killed. I am sure, the age will come when both the work of others and the task will be treated with more honour. All in all it was a great adventure to create a contemporary sculpture of monumental size in the heart of Buda under professional manufacturing circumstances (with enthusiastic workers). </p>
            <p>Thanks to the supporters understanding the cause. </p>
